# Indian-Flag
This HTML and CSS code creates a simplified Indian flag with three color bands: saffron, white (with the Ashoka Chakra centered), and green. The Chakra is placed using absolute positioning. The flag sections are responsive with height set to 33.3vh, adapting to viewport size for better flexibility.
